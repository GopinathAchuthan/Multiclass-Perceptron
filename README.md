# Multiclass-Perceptron
This project contains the python code for Multi-class perceptron Model.
I used MNIST digits dataset. 
Each row in the data file is 784 integers that represents the grayscale values of a 28 X 28 handwritten digit.
Each row in the labels file is a single digit in the range 0-9 and is in a 1-to-1 correspondence with rows in the data file.

This project code is generic, it applies from similar dataset i.e., with different range.
